# SnoozeLooseAlarmApp
COMP4107 Malardelen HÃ¶gskola -Alarm App <br />
The idea behind this project is to create an app that will help users stop snoozing their alarms in the morning. In order to discipline the user we have the idea of punishing them upon pressing the snooze button. The punishment in this case will be to charge the user a fee that will be donated to a charity. The amount of money charged is set by the user depending on how important they deem the alarm to be. Which charity the money goes to is also chosen by the user themselves.
